## **Review of “AIOpsLab: A Holistic Framework to Evaluate AI Agents for Enabling Autonomous Clouds” by: [Peper Cruz - orcid.org#: 0009-0001-4034-0056](https://orcid.org/0009-0001-4034-0056)**

**Summary:**  
This paper proposes *AIOpsLab*, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI agents in cloud operations. It integrates deployment orchestration, fault injection, workload generation, telemetry collection, and task evaluation to benchmark agent capabilities across realistic AIOps scenarios.

**Strengths:**  
- The paper clearly motivates the need for holistic evaluation of AI agents in cloud environments.  
- The design of modular components (orchestrator, fault injector, telemetry, task taxonomy) is well-structured.  
- Evaluation with a set of benchmark problems demonstrates practical insights into agent behavior.

**Weaknesses / Suggestions:**  
- The experimental evaluation could include additional baseline agents or comparative metrics for broader context.  
- Some evaluation metrics and task difficulty criteria would benefit from clearer justification.  
- A discussion of reproducibility and open-source release practices would strengthen the contribution.

**Overall Recommendation:**  
*Accept with minor revisions.* The work makes a valuable contribution to AI agent evaluation frameworks with practical relevance to both research and industry.
